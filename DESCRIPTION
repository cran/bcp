Description: Provides an implementation of the Barry and Hartigan (1993) product
    partition model for the normal errors change point problem using Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo. It also extends the methodology to regression models on a connected
    graph (Wang and Emerson, 2015); this allows estimation of change point models
    with multivariate responses. Parallel MCMC, previously available in bcp v.3.0.0,
    is currently not implemented.
